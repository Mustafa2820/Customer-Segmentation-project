information from 10 different malls between 2021 and 2023, provides a comprehensive view of shopping habits in Istanbul, incorporating data from various age groups and genders. It includes essential details such as invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations. I've analyzed this dataset, uncovering interesting insights. Additionally, I performed Excel pivot tables and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python. Furthermore, I created a dashboard to present the findings visually.
